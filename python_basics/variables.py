"""
You can think about variables as words that store a value. Simple as that.

In Python, it is really easy to define a variable and set a value to it.

"""And you can assign any other value to whatever other variables you want. As you see in the table above, the variable “two” stores the integer 2, and “some_number” stores 10,000.

Besides integers, we can also use booleans (True / False), strings, float, and so many other data types."""
